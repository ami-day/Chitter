<h1 align="center">Chitter</h1>

<p align="center">
In this solo project, I integrated a SQL database in Python using the psycopg package to create a small web application called Chitter. Chitter is a web application where you can log-in as a user, post messages and view other Chitter users messages. I implemented this project using Flask, Pytest, HTML, CSS and Jinja templates.</p>
