In this solo project, I integrated a SQL database using the python psycopg package to create a small web application called "Chitter". Chitter is a web application where you can log-in as a user, post messages and view other Chitter users messages. I implemented this project using Flask, Pytest, HTML and Jinja templates.

To run the application, clone the respository and run "pipenv install", then go to: http://127.0.0.1:5000/login to access the login page.
